# Java-Servlet-Junit-SampleApp

A sample Java web application to understand basic servlet, Junit and applying CSS templates.

Steps to create the Java web app. 
1.Open eclipse and select File - New - Dynamic web project.
2.Under webcontent folder, create a new jsp file named Customer.jsp 
3.Create a InsertCustomerServlet.java servlet class. While submitting the form from the “Customer.jsp” page the servlet will 
get the form value in HttpServletRequest object .
4.Create a Bean Class to store information received in Servlet class. 
5.Create a Welcome.Jsp file to display the data from first screen.
6.Connect the flow using web.xml using appropriate Servlet and Servlet-mapping values.
I have played around with some HTML templates to beautify the app..
